# Kotlin Design Patterns [Video]
This is the code repository for [Kotlin Design Patterns [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/kotlin-design-patterns-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Over the years, programmers have run into pretty much the same problems time and time again; not every problem is entirely unique. Therefore, over time programmers applied varying solutions to these problems, and this is how design patterns were born.
This course will walk you through some centrally significant design patterns so that you can easily resolve programming issues encountered in your day-to-day tasks. You'll learn these patterns in one of the most modern languages: Kotlin! We cover the three major areas in design patterns: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. We also implement one structural pattern—Decorators—that plays an important role in adding functionalities to your programs. We take a look at different kinds of problem and implement the required patterns while avoiding common pitfalls. We also supply useful tips and tricks to use design patterns more effectively.
By the end of the course, you will be confident about using varying types of design patterns to solve common design problems.
Please note that a basic familiarity with Kotlin is desirable to get the most out of this course, along with some experience working with Android Studio.
